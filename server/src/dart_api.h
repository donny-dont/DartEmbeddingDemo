// --- Handles ---

/**
 * An object reference managed by the Dart VM garbage collector.
 *
 * Because the garbage collector may move objects, it is unsafe to
 * refer to objects directly. Instead, we refer to objects through
 * handles, which are known to the garbage collector and updated
 * automatically when the object is moved. Handles should be passed
 * by value (except in cases like out-parameters) and should never be
 * allocated on the heap.
 *
 * Most functions in the Dart Embedding API return a handle. When a
 * function completes normally, this will be a valid handle to an
 * object in the Dart VM heap. This handle may represent the result of
 * the operation or it may be a special valid handle used merely to
 * indicate successful completion. Note that a valid handle may in
 * some cases refer to the null object.
 *
 * --- Error handles ---
 *
 * When a function encounters a problem that prevents it from
 * completing normally, it returns an error handle (See Dart_IsError).
 * An error handle has an associated error message that gives more
 * details about the problem (See Dart_GetError).
 *
 * There are four kinds of error handles that can be produced,
 * depending on what goes wrong:
 *
 * - Api error handles are produced when an api function is misused.
 *   This happens when a Dart embedding api function is called with
 *   invalid arguments or in an invalid context.
 *
 * - Unhandled exception error handles are produced when, during the
 *   execution of Dart code, an exception is thrown but not caught.
 *   Prototypically this would occur during a call to Dart_Invoke, but
 *   it can occur in any function which triggers the execution of Dart
 *   code (for example, Dart_ToString).
 *
 *   An unhandled exception error provides access to an exception and
 *   stacktrace via the functions Dart_ErrorGetException and
 *   Dart_ErrorGetStacktrace.
 *
 * - Compilation error handles are produced when, during the execution
 *   of Dart code, a compile-time error occurs.  As above, this can
 *   occur in any function which triggers the execution of Dart code.
 *
 * - Fatal error handles are produced when the system wants to shut
 *   down the current isolate.
 *
 * --- Propagating errors ---
 *
 * When an error handle is returned from the top level invocation of
 * Dart code in a program, the embedder must handle the error as they
 * see fit.  Often, the embedder will print the error message produced
 * by Dart_Error and exit the program.
 *
 * When an error is returned while in the body of a native function,
 * it can be propagated by calling Dart_PropagateError.  Errors should
 * be propagated unless there is a specific reason not to.  If an
 * error is not propagated then it is ignored.  For example, if an
 * unhandled exception error is ignored, that effectively "catches"
 * the unhandled exception.  Fatal errors must always be propagated.
 *
 * Note that a call to Dart_PropagateError never returns.  Instead it
 * transfers control non-locally using a setjmp-like mechanism.  This
 * can be inconvenient if you have resources that you need to clean up
 * before propagating the error.  When an error is propagated, any
 * current scopes created by Dart_EnterScope will be exited.
 *
 * To deal with this inconvenience, we often return error handles
 * rather than propagating them from helper functions.  Consider the
 * following contrived example:
 *
 * 1    Dart_Handle isLongStringHelper(Dart_Handle arg) {
 * 2      intptr_t* length = 0;
 * 3      result = Dart_StringLength(arg, &length);
 * 4      if (Dart_IsError(result)) {
 * 5        return result
 * 6      }
 * 7      return Dart_NewBoolean(length > 100);
 * 8    }
 * 9
 * 10   void NativeFunction_isLongString(Dart_NativeArguments args) {
 * 11     Dart_EnterScope();
 * 12     AllocateMyResource();
 * 13     Dart_Handle arg = Dart_GetNativeArgument(args, 0);
 * 14     Dart_Handle result = isLongStringHelper(arg);
 * 15     if (Dart_IsError(result)) {
 * 16       FreeMyResource();
 * 17       Dart_PropagateError(result);
 * 18       abort();  // will not reach here
 * 19     }
 * 20     Dart_SetReturnValue(result);
 * 21     FreeMyResource();
 * 22     Dart_ExitScope();
 * 23   }
 *
 * In this example, we have a native function which calls a helper
 * function to do its work.  On line 5, the helper function could call
 * Dart_PropagateError, but that would not give the native function a
 * chance to call FreeMyResource(), causing a leak.  Instead, the
 * helper function returns the error handle to the caller, giving the
 * caller a chance to clean up before propagating the error handle.
 *
 * --- Local and persistent handles ---
 *
 * Local handles are allocated within the current scope (see
 * Dart_EnterScope) and go away when the current scope exits. Unless
 * otherwise indicated, callers should assume that all functions in
 * the Dart embedding api return local handles.
 *
 * Persistent handles are allocated within the current isolate. They
 * can be used to store objects across scopes. Persistent handles have
 * the lifetime of the current isolate unless they are explicitly
 * deallocated (see Dart_DeletePersistentHandle).
